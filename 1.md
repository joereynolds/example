a) Keep the primary key and also have a UUID and use them together as a compound
key. The user could have the primary key exposed as a 'user-friendly' id,
whereas the system could rely on the UUID's.

b) The users initials, DOB, and some small extract from `uniqid()`
i.e.

```
uniqid("JHR90-", true);
```
